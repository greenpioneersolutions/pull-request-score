`pull-request-score` gathers GitHub pull request data and summarizes it so you can spot trends in delivery speed, review health and CI reliability. The CLI fetches PRs, calculates metrics like cycle time or merge rate and writes them out as JSON or CSV. You can also use the library directly to integrate metrics in your own tools.

This website documents all commands and metrics in detail. Check out the sidebar for API guides and the metric reference.
